Facts about HTTP 1.1:
    1. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
    2. HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.
    3. In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
    4. It works on the textual format.
    5. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
    6. It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
    7. It compresses data by itself.

Facts about HTTP 2:
    1. HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
    2. HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
    3. Many browsers supported this standardization effort, including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari.
    4. It works on the binary protocol.
    5. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
    6. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
    7. It uses HPACK for data compression.
