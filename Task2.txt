Objects: 
    Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
    For instance,
        const obj = {name: 'Niranjani', age: 23}
    So here 'name' , 'age' represents the keys and 'Niranjani' , '23' represents the values of the object.
    Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
    An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
    That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
    The variables don’t actually store the value.

Arrays:
    Arrays in JavaScript may be defined as a collection of related data in the form of 'index - value' pairs.
    For instance,
        const arr = [5];
        0 1 2 3 4 ------Index
        1 2 3 4 5 ------Value
    So here first row represents the index and the second row represents the value of the array.
